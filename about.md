I am a software engineer currently focused on cloud computing and machine learning technologies, and leadership in vision, strategy, planning, and execution of development projects and business initiatives. This is my personal blog site where I write about random technical topics that interest me.

Over the course of my career, I have delivered many enterprise-grade, high-scale, commercial software and enterprise applications using C# and .NET, Java and J2EE, JavaScript, Smalltalk, Python, and many other languages; with projects from client-server, web applications, middleware, service-orientation, distributed systems, mobile apps, microservices, to serverless and data-driven architectures.

I am fascinated by code, its design and usage, and the resulting software we can create with code; and particularly  interested learning from others. I rarely express opinions here, but when I do, theyâ€™re my personal opinions and not those of any company I work at.
