Dragon Adventure is a world simulation game built for Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8. It gives players a chance to interact with an ancient virtual village where everyone completes tasks for points that can then be used to acquire new capabilities.

Players can explore fantasy-style landscapes — layered on a map of the real world — while flying around on the back of a dragon from the film. This model represents a hybrid of exploration and actual gameplay, and it is an interesting experiment that blends different mobile technologies as well as movies, games, and the real world.
