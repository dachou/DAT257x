The Windows device features the 8” Toshiba Encore 2 tablet running Windows embedded 8.1 Industry with a an Intel® Atom™ processor and a lightweight security shell/stand that together weigh less than one pound.  Alaska Airlines offers the tablet for free to passengers in the First Class cabin and for rental to passengers in coach.  The airline offers the tablet on most routes over 3.5 hours.
