On November 3, 2008, Microsoft Chief Software Architect Ray Ozzie introduced Windows Azure and Azure Services Platform during the PDC2008 opening keynote. I played a small role as part of the team ([more details here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2008-12-01-meba %})) that spent a couple of months earlier in the year working on one of the projects demonstrated during the day 1 keynote presentation. 

Specifically, it was the RedPrairie supply chain management solution discussed during Bob Muglia's (Senior Vice President of the Server and Tools Business) keynote (fast forward to about 48 minutes into the video at <https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/pdc2008/KYN01>).

This wasn't a world-changing event like Apple's announcement of the iPhone, and probably a scenario that not a lot of people are familiar with, but it addresses a real business need in the supply chain management space, and how the cloud can serve as an effective solution for the currently fragmented landscape of B2B business processes.

There's a more detailed discussion of the challenges in the earlier post about [Multi-Enterprise Business Applications]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2008-12-01-meba %}). Basically, the current B2B business process domain is fraught with a diverse set of standards and protocols, a myriad of technologies, and each widely varied custom implementations at each of the many organizations involved in a supply chain relationship.

The cloud provides an effective solution in helping to centralize and minimize the custom work each organization has to implement, in order to communicate with others. For example, with buiness processes managed in the cloud, organizations only need to implement the necessary communication protocols and security measures with the cloud platform (in this case one-to-one with Windows Azure), as opposed to needing to do something customized for each organization (many-to-many).

The RedPrairie Cloud-Based "One Button Recall" solution demonstrated in the keynote represents a multi-enterprise business application that leverages the Microsoft (Cloud) Services platform, to deliver a sophisticated product recall orchestration between multiple partners (in this case - AdventureWorks, Contoso, Fabrikam, and Litware) in a dynamic supply chain network. The cloud services implementation helps articulate business and technical values of the S+S model, and how the (Cloud) services platform add value to RedPrairieâ€™s current software solutions, by connecting, managing, and interacting with on-premise solutions across enterprise boundaries.

Again, this is a neat scenario because it isn't about running existing server-based software in the cloud (treating it as another outsourced hosting service). RedPrairie's existing business product management software can continue to run on-premises to orchestrate the process across the multiple partners (who also have their software still running on-premises), but the communication, authentication, authorization, and message orchestration can be implemented and managed in the cloud, simplifying the solution each organization needs to implement in order to automate the entire supply chain.
