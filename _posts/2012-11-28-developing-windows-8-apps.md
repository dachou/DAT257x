It was a realy interesting experience filming these videos at the Microsoft Studios facility, which is just as sophisticated and professional as the major media studios I have visited before, such as at Disney, Fox, Universal, etc.

Our work space includes all the amenities - filming studio, editing room with all the equipment, green room with comfortable furnishings and decorations, makeup room, etc.; and with catering all provided. Just showing a few photos here that don't disclose too many details.

It was fun pretending to be an actor for a day, though I now have some appreciation of the kind of work actors go through, and how hard it is to be a good actor. And yes, sometimes we wonder why was a particular person placed in a certain role in a show (such as in the case for those videos above) as undoubtedly they must have better options. From that perspective, I now also have a bit of appreciation for people who work in casting. And of course, the director, content/script team, makeup team, camera team, audio team, editing team, etc.; it's pretty amazing how much work goes into producing well-made content (bad actors aside).

As hard it is for me to watch and listen to myself in a video, it might not be any easier for anyone else as well - hence my apologies for playing a role in bringing these videos to life (my kids were giggling as they watched them so I guess that's one positive). ðŸ˜‰ Regardless, I appreciate being given the opportunity to do something different, and get a behind-the-scenes look at how these things are put together.

Now back to my day job.
