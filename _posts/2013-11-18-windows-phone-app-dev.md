Visited [Devoxx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devoxx) in Antwerp, Belgium last week. Devoxx being the largest Java conference outside of the US, and purely organized by the community, it is an event I have always wanted to attend.

I delivered a talk during a breakout session, describing the current state of the Microsoft development platform, which presented a view that can deliver rich and seamless user experiences that span client platforms and cloud platforms.

And of course, an overview of Windows Azure as the cloud platform, that has grown up significantly since its introduction in 2008.
