The [School of Dragons](https://schoolofdragons.com) 3D MMORPG lets users play in the DreamWorks Animation “How To Train Your Dragon” universe with all the dragons and their Viking friends from the film franchise. Through a game-based learning environment, users can learn everything from science basics to the art of shooting fireballs, all while soaring through the skies on the back of a dragon.

The game client built for Windows was released on August 4th. It supports many Windows-specific features such as Live Tiles, lockscreen notifications, share charm integration, pin feature to Start, snap screen, etc. Then now we have the announcement about the developer Jumpstart using Azure to run all the backend services that support the School of Dragons game.
